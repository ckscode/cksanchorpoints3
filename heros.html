       <p> <h2 id="IronMAn">Iron man</h2>
    Iron Man is a 2008 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics
    character of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by
    Paramount Pictures,[N 1] it is the first film in the Marvel Cinematic
    Universe (MCU). Directed by Jon Favreau from a screenplay by the writing
    teams of Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, the
    film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man alongside Terrence
    Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub, and Gwyneth Paltrow. In the film,
    following his escape from captivity by a terrorist group, world famous
    industrialist and master engineer Tony Stark builds a mechanized suit of
    armor and becomes the superhero Iron Man. A film featuring the character was
    in development at Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and New Line Cinema
    at various times since 1990, before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in
    2006. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film,
    with Paramount Pictures distributing. Favreau signed on as director in April
    2006, and faced opposition from Marvel when trying to cast Downey in the
    title role; the actor was signed in September. Filming took place from March
    to June 2007, primarily in California to differentiate the film from
    numerous other superhero stories that are set in New York City-esque
    environments. During filming, the actors were free to create their own
    dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber
    and metal versions of the armor, created by Stan Winston's company, were
    mixed with computer-generated imagery to create the title character. Iron
    Man premiered in Sydney on April 14, 2008, and was released in the United
    States on May 2, as the first film in Phase One of the MCU. It grossed over
    $585 million, becoming the eighth-highest grossing film of 2008. The film
    received praise from critics, especially for Downey's performance. It was
    selected by the American Film Institute as one of the ten best films of 2008
    and received two nominations at the 81st Academy Awards for Best Sound
    Editing and Best Visual Effects. Two sequels have been released: Iron Man 2
    (2010) and Iron Man 3 (2013).<br /><br />

         <p><h2 id="captain">Captain America</h2>
    Captain America: The First Avenger is a 2011 American superhero film based
    on the Marvel Comics character Captain America. Produced by Marvel Studios
    and distributed by Paramount Pictures,[N 1] it is the fifth film in the
    Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Joe Johnston,
    written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and stars Chris Evans as
    Steve Rogers / Captain America alongside Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving,
    Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Dominic Cooper, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke,
    and Stanley Tucci. During World War II, Steve Rogers, a frail man, is
    transformed into the super-soldier Captain America and must stop the Red
    Skull (Weaving) from using the Tesseract as an energy source for world
    domination. The film began as a concept in 1997 and was scheduled for
    distribution by Artisan Entertainment. However, a lawsuit disrupted the
    project and was not settled until September 2003. In 2005, Marvel Studios
    received a loan from Merrill Lynch, and planned to finance and release the
    film through Paramount Pictures. Directors Jon Favreau and Louis Leterrier
    were interested in directing the project before Johnston was approached in
    2008. The principal characters were cast between March and June 2010.
    Production began in June, and filming took place in London, Manchester,
    Caerwent, Liverpool, and Los Angeles. Several different techniques were used
    by the visual effects company Lola to create the physical appearance of the
    character before he becomes Captain America. Captain America: The First
    Avenger premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on July 19, 2011, and was
    released in the United States on July 22, as part of Phase One of the MCU.
    The film was commercially successful, grossing over $370 million worldwide.
    Critics particularly praised Evans' performance, the film's depiction of its
    1940s time period, and Johnston's direction. Two sequels have been released:
    Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and Captain America: Civil War
    (2016).<br /><br />

     <p> <h2 id="hulk">Hulk</h2>
      The Hulk is a fictional superhero appearing in publications by the
      American publisher Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist
      Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the debut issue of The
      Incredible Hulk (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character
      is both the Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid
      possessing a vast degree of physical strength, and his alter ego Dr.
      Robert Bruce Banner, a physically weak, socially withdrawn, and
      emotionally reserved physicist. The two exist as independent dissociative
      personalities, and resent each other. Following his accidental exposure to
      gamma rays saving the life of Rick Jones during the detonation of an
      experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when
      subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will, often leading to
      destructive rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life.
      The Hulk's level of strength is normally conveyed as proportionate to his
      level of anger. Commonly portrayed as a raging savage, the Hulk has been
      represented with other personalities based on Banner's fractured psyche,
      from a mindless, destructive force, to a brilliant warrior, or genius
      scientist in his own right. Despite both Hulk and Banner's desire for
      solitude, the character has a large supporting cast. This includes
      Banner's lover Betty Ross, his best friend Rick Jones, his cousin
      She-Hulk, and therapist and ally Doc Samson. In addition, the Hulk alter
      ego has many key supporting characters like his co-founders of the
      superhero team the Avengers, his queen Caiera, fellow warriors Korg and
      Miek, and sons Skaar and Hiro-Kala. However, his uncontrollable power has
      brought him into conflict with his fellow heroes and others. Despite this,
      he tries his best to do what's right while battling villains such as
      Leader, Abomination, Absorbing Man and more. Lee stated that the Hulk's
      creation was inspired by a combination of Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and
      Mr. Hyde.[3] Although the Hulk's coloration has varied throughout the
      character's publication history, the most usual color is green. One of the
      most iconic characters in popular culture,[4][5] the character has
      appeared on a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectable
      items, inspired real-world structures (such as theme park attractions),
      and been referenced in a number of media. Banner and the Hulk have been
      adapted in live-action, animated, and video game incarnations. The
      character was first played in a live-action feature film by Eric Bana. In
      the Marvel Cinematic Universe,[not verified in body] the character was
      portrayed by Edward Norton in the film The Incredible Hulk (2008) and by
      Mark Ruffalo in the films The Avengers (2012), Iron Man 3 (2013) in a
      cameo, Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Avengers:
      Infinity War (2018), Captain Marvel (2019) in a cameo, Avengers: Endgame
      (2019),Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) in a cameo, and in
      the limited series What If...?. Ruffalo will reprise the role in the
      upcoming Disney+ series She-Hulk (2022)

      <p> <h2 id="thor">Thor</h2>
    Thor is a 2011 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures,[N 1] it is the fourth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It was directed by Kenneth Branagh, written by the writing team of Ashley Edward Miller and Zack Stentz along with Don Payne, and stars Chris Hemsworth as the title character alongside Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgård, Colm Feore, Ray Stevenson, Idris Elba, Kat Dennings, Rene Russo, and Anthony Hopkins. After reigniting a dormant war, Thor is banished from Asgard to Earth, stripped of his powers and his hammer Mjölnir. As his brother Loki (Hiddleston) plots to take the Asgardian throne, Thor must prove himself worthy.
Sam Raimi first developed the concept of a film adaptation based on Thor in 1991, but soon abandoned the project, leaving it in "development hell" for several years. During this time, the rights were picked up by various film studios until Marvel signed Mark Protosevich to develop the project in 2006, and planned to finance and release it through Paramount. Matthew Vaughn was assigned to direct the film for a tentative 2010 release. However, after Vaughn was released from his holding deal in 2008, Branagh was approached and the film's release was rescheduled to 2011. The main characters were cast in 2009, and principal photography took place in California and New Mexico from January to May 2010. The film was converted to 3D in post-production.
Thor premiered in Sydney on April 17, 2011, and was released in the United States on May 6, as part of Phase One of the MCU. The film was a financial success, earning $449.3 million worldwide. Critics praised the performances, characters, themes and special effects but criticized the plot. Two sequels have been released: Thor: The Dark World (2013) and Thor: Ragnarok (2017). A fourth film, Thor: Love and Thunder, is scheduled to be released in July 2022.
